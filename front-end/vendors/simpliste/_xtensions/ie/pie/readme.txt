http://css3pie.com/PIE script makes IE 6-9 understand some of CSS3 properties: border-radiusbox-shadowlinear-gradient (with -pie- prefix only)Script requires jQuery http://jquery.com/ To use it copy PIE.js to the javascript files folder, include link to the script in your pages in this way<!--[if lt IE 10]><script type="text/javascript" src="js/PIE.js"></script><![endif]-->And invoke the script on elements with CSS3 properties. You can do it by adding special class to every such element (.rounded in example) or by listing existing classes in your javascript block ('.menu_main a, .menu_bottom a')$(function() {    if (window.PIE) {        $('.rounded').each(function() {            PIE.attach(this);        });    }});PS Sometimes you will need to change the "position" property of the elements with PIE applied to "relative", it will help you to avoid some bugs:.rounded {  position:relative;}
